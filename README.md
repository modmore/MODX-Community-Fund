# MODX Community Fund

The MODX Community Fund is an initiative by (https://www.modmore.com)[modmore] to make financial aid available to people in the community with an idea or project that will benefit MODX. This can be anything from hosting a meetup (which can cost money for drinks or speaker compensation) to contributing to the MODX core or developing a useful extra. 

In this repository we're scoping out the Fund and relevant processes. You, as part of the MODX Community, are invited to contribute to this by submitting issues and pull requests. Feedback and new ideas are very much welcome.
